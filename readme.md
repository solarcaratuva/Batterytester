### This project was developed by the UVa Solar Car Team in order to test large numbers of lithium ion 18650 cells. By testing ESR and capacity one can be confident that each and every cell tested performs as expected and no cells have arrived DOA. Individually characterizing and 'binning' each cell allows us to arrange the cells in the final battery bank such that each module will have as close to identical capacity, reducing the chance of the modules SoC from drifting significantly over charge/discharge cycles.
